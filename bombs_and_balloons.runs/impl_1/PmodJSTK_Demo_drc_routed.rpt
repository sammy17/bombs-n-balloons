PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vga/vga_controller/scene_reg_10[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga/vga_controller/dec_digit_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell vga/vga_controller/dec_digit_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
